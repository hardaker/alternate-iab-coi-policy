# INTERNET ARCHITECTURE BOARD CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

This policy covers the nomcom-selected Internet Architecture Board (IAB) members and ex-officio members (collectively, “Covered Individuals”). This policy has no impact on any other participants in IAB activities, for instance liaisons to and from the IAB or IAB program members.

In carrying out their IAB role, Covered Individuals must act in the best interest of the Internet community. Occasionally this duty may be—or may appear to be—incompatible or in conflict with a Covered Individual’s personal interests (including interests of their family members), or the interests of an organization of which the Covered Individual is an employee, director, owner, or otherwise has business or financial interest.

The IAB does not directly deal with matters relating to contracts or finance. The IAB does, however, have a role in personnel decisions, and its decisions and outputs have a potential to indirectly affect contracts within the IETF system. The IAB's technical decisions and outputs have also a potential to impact both work elsewhere in the IETF and businesses that employ or develop Internet technology.

Topics where potential disclosure of potential conflicts is recommended include, but is not limited to:

1. Confirming the IETF Chair and Area Directors
2. Standards appeals
3. The RFC Series Editor
4. Liason roles
5. Advice to ISOC
6. Appointing an ISOC Trustee

Covered Individuals shall not use the IAB’s resources or decisions as a means for personal or third-party gain.

## Disclosure of Actual or Potential Conflicts

The IAB requires that all Covered Individuals disclose their main employment, sponsorship, consulting customer, or other sources of income when entering the IAB or whenever there are updates.

In addition, when a topic is discussed at the IAB, the Covered Individuals are required to promptly disclose if that topic constitutes a perceived or potential conflict of interest.  Once disclosed, Covered Individuals may recuse from participation in discussions or decisions at their discretion.

The specific conflicts that may cause a perceived or potential conflict of interest are matters for individual and IAB judgment, but generally come in the following forms:

* A personnel decision relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member. For the purposes of this policy, a "person working closely with" is someone working in the same team or project, or a direct manager or employee of the Covered Individual. And "family" means a spouse, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent, stepchild, stepparent, and mother-, father-, son-, daughter-, brother-, or sister-in-law, and any other person living in the same household, except tenants and household employees.

* A decision or output from the IAB impacts a contract that the IETF enters into with a party, and that party relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member.

* Activity on the IAB involves discussion and decisions regarding technical matters, mainly related to IETF
activities. As an activity adjacent to a standardization process, it is often the case that Covered Individuals will have some (frequently non-financial) stake in the outcome of discussions or decisions that relate to technical matters.  This policy does not require that Covered Individuals disclose such conflicts of interest as they relate to technical matters. However, Covered Individuals need to exercise their judgment and, in extraordinary cases be willing to disclose potential or perceived conflicts of interest even as they relate to technical matters. For example, if a Covered Individual's sponsor were in the process of entering a new market where there is an ongoing IAB discussion, then disclosure, or even recusal, might be appropriate, even if difficult.

## Disclosure Transparency

A person's recusal to participate in the discussion of a topic is always noted in the public IAB minutes. In addition, the IAB will maintain repository of all general disclosures of employment and other sponsorship. It is expected that much of this repository is public, but there can be situations where some disclosures (such as customers of consultants) are private.

# Status

There has been some discusssion of bullet 3, and while there was some convergence on the mailing list, not final acknowledgment of agreement.
