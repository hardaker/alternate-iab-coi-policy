# INTERNET ARCHITECTURE BOARD CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

This policy covers the nomcom-selected Internet Architecture Board (IAB) members, as well as the IETF and IRTF chairs in their IAB roles (collectively, “Covered Individuals”). This policy has no impact on any other participants in IAB activities, for instance liaisons to and from the IAB or IAB program members.

In carrying out their IAB role, Covered Individuals must act in the best interest of the Internet community. Occasionally this duty may be—or may appear to be—incompatible or in conflict with a Covered Individual’s personal interests (including interests of their family members), or the interests of an organization of which the Covered Individual is an employee, director, owner, or otherwise has business or financial interest. If this occurs, or if for any other reason a Covered Individual is unable to make unbiased or impartial decisions in connection with their IAB activities, the Covered Individual has a potential conflict of interest that must be documented, disclosed, addressed, avoided, and/or eliminated.

The IAB does not directly deal with matters relating to contracts or finance. The IAB does, however, have a role in personnel decisions, and its decisions and outputs have a potential to indirectly affect contracts within the IETF system. IAB's technical decisions and outputs have also a potential to impact both work elsewhere in the IETF and businesses that employ or develop Internet technology.

As a general principle, Covered Individuals shall not use the IAB’s resources or decisions as a means for personal or third-party gain.

## Disclosure of Actual or Potential Conflicts

The IAB requires that all Covered Individuals disclose their main employment, sponsorship, consulting customer, or other financial ties when entering the IAB or whenever there are updates.

In addition, when a topic is discussed at the IAB, the Covered Individuals are required to promptly disclose if that topic constitutes a perceived or potential conflict of interest, and to suggest a remedy for resolving the conflict, such  as recusal recusal from the discussion or decision. The remainder of the IAB can challenge an assessment or lack thereof provided by the Covered Individual, and decide to recuse the Covered Individual from the discussion.

The specific conflicts that may cause a perceived or potential conflict of interest are matters for individual and IAB judgment, but generally come in the following forms:

* A personnel decision relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member. For the purposes of this policy, a "person working closely with" is someone working in the same team or project, or a direct manager or employee of the Covered Individual. And "family" means a spouse, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent, stepchild, stepparent, and mother-, father-, son-, daughter-, brother-, or sister-in-law, and any other person living in the same household, except tenants and household employees.

* A decision or output from the IAB may impact a contract that the IETF enters into with a party, and that party relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member.

* A decision or output from the IAB may impact a specific business or development at a party that relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member. As the Internet technology in general affects a large number of businesses, a mere general impact does not lead to a conflict. Rather, the issue needs to be more specific, such as raising an issue or recommendation about a topic where the affected party is in a major role.

## Disclosure Transparency

A person's recusal to participate in the discussion of a topic is always noted in the public IAB minutes. In addition, the IAB will maintain a private repository of all general disclosures of employment and other ties.
