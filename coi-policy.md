# INTERNET ARCHITECTURE BOARD CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY

This policy covers the nomcom-selected Internet Architecture Board (IAB) members and ex-officio members (collectively, “Covered Individuals”). This policy has no impact on any other participants in IAB activities, for instance liaisons to and from the IAB or IAB program members.

In carrying out their IAB role, Covered Individuals must act in the best interest of the Internet community. Occasionally this duty may be—or may appear to be—incompatible or in conflict with a Covered Individual’s personal interests (including interests of their family members), or the interests of an organization of which the Covered Individual is an employee, director, owner, or otherwise has business or other current or future financial interest.

Covered Individuals shall not use the IAB’s resources or decisions as a means for personal or third-party gain.

## Topics Requiring Disclosure Consideration

Topics where disclosure of potential conflicts may be required
include, but is not limited to:

1. Confirming the IETF Chair and Area Directors
2. Standards appeals
3. The RFC Series Editor
4. Liason roles
5. Advice to ISOC
6. Appointing an ISOC Trustee

The IAB does not directly deal with matters relating to contracts or finance. The IAB does, however, have a role in personnel decisions, and its decisions and outputs have a potential to indirectly affect contracts within the IETF system. The IAB's technical decisions and outputs have also a potential to impact both work elsewhere in the IETF and businesses that employ or develop Internet technology.

Activity on the IAB involves discussion and decisions regarding technical matters, mainly related to IETF activities. As an activity adjacent to a standardization process, it is often the case that Covered Individuals will have some (frequently non-financial) stake in the outcome of discussions or decisions that relate to technical matters.  Covered Individuals should exercise their judgment about when disclosure is necessary in technical matters, erring on the side of transparency but recusal being rare.

## Sources of Potential Conflicts

The IAB requires that all Covered Individuals publicly disclose their main employment, sponsorship, consulting customer, or other relevant sources of income when entering the IAB or whenever there are updates.

In addition, when a topic is discussed within the IAB, the Covered Individuals are required to promptly disclose if that topic constitutes a perceived or potential conflict of interest.

Specific conflicts that may cause a perceived or potential conflict of interest are matters for individual and IAB judgment and include but are not limited to:

* A personnel decision relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member. For the purposes of this policy, a "person working closely with" is someone working in the same team or project, or a direct manager or employee of the Covered Individual. And "family" means a spouse, domestic partner, child, sibling, parent, stepchild, stepparent, and mother-, father-, son-, daughter-, brother-, or sister-in-law, and any other person living in the same household, except tenants and household employees.

* A decision or output from the IAB that may impact a contract that the IETF enters into with a party, and that party relates to the Covered Individual, a colleague that the Covered Individual's works closely with, or a family member.

* The success of a Covered Individual's business depends significantly on the outcome of an IAB discussion or decision.

## Disclosure and Recusal Procedure

Aside from general employment and relevant income public disclosures required above, any Covered Individual's other potential conflicts of interest shall be disclosed internally to the IAB.  Covered Individuals may choose to recuse themselves from participation in discussions or decisions at their discretion.  The IAB may also deliberate on the disclosed potential conflict and may request that the Covered Individual recuse themselves from discussions or decisions.

Recusal is expected to be rare in occurrence, as the IAB participates in discussions about a diverse set of topics.  The IETF's nomination committee (nomcom) that appoints IAB members is expected to provide the IAB with a diverse set of board members to balance the board's viewpoints with different priorities and opinions.

## Recusal Transparency

When a Covered Individual recuses from a decision or discussion, it will be noted in the public IAB minutes.
